# Adding the Space Video Background

To complete the space video background implementation, follow these steps:

1. Place your "The Universe and Space.mp4" file in the `my-portfolio/public/` directory.

2. If your video has a different filename, update the source in the `VideoBackground.js` component:
   ```jsx
   <source src="/YourActualFileName.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
   ```

## Video Recommendations

For the best experience:

- Use an MP4 video with good compression (ideally under 10MB)
- Choose a video with subtle motion that won't distract from your content
- Make sure the video has good contrast with text (dark space backgrounds work well)
- Consider adding a video that's at least 1920x1080 resolution

## Performance Considerations

The video background adds visual appeal but may affect performance on lower-end devices. The implementation:

- Automatically mutes the video (required for autoplay)
- Sets the video to loop continuously
- Uses CSS to reduce opacity and ensure content readability
- Disables the video on mobile devices and for users with reduced motion preferences

## Troubleshooting

If the video doesn't appear:
1. Confirm the video file is in the correct location
2. Check browser console for any errors
3. Ensure the video format is supported by most browsers (MP4 with H.264 codec is recommended)
